# Space_Savers
A game made with scratch about space debris.

This game was made with Scratch by 4 high schoolers: 2 of them wrote the coding part and the other 2 made designs.
Theme: After sending satellites into orbit since the 20th century, space is filled with broken satellites, spaceships, and space debris. A professor sent an astronaut to clean the debris while warning being careful about aliens and avoid crushing them.

P.s. As the rocket gets hit, it becomes whiter.
